// All crash diagnostic hooks have been disabled due to:
// - 0x42C26C: Normal memory operation called millions of times (2GB logs in 10min)
// - 0x584BD8: Causing Syringe memory access errors  
// - 0x4A38C0: Causing startup crash
// - 0x693FEF30: Causing Syringe memory access errors
//
// The crash investigation revealed:
// 1. Counter overflows (972, 1262 > max 512) 
// 2. Massive memory clearing operations (7019+ cycles)
// 3. Object pointer corruption during Ares cleanup
// 4. Final crash at 0x0781002C with corrupted EAX=0x73
//
// Root cause appears to be memory pool exhaustion in late-game scenarios
// with high unit counts (7 AI players), leading to cleanup corruption.
